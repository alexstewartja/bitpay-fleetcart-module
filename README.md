button: ![Generate API Token Button](https://i.ibb.co/yXxktj2/generate-api-token-btn.png)

production.

After successful generation, approve your new Merchant Token by clicking the link provided. The link will take you to
your BitPay merchant dashboard to confirm approval. After approving, you will be ready to start accepting crypto payments
with **BitPay for FleetCart**!
